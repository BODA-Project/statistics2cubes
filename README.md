# Statistics2Cube 

Statistics2Cube is a open source research prototype. It implements a Data-Integration workflow for faulty und complex structured tables.
TEI-based tables can be imported, modified and exported using the [RDF Data Cube Vocabulary](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/).

**Paper Abstract:**

This work describes a Data-Integration process, in particular, how XML-based TEI documents with statistical data can be normalized, converted and enriched using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary. Due to the their inherent complex structure, a simple row-by-row based conversion approach is not sufficient. Therefore, the complex structured tables must be validated, modified and transformed, until they are suitable for the standardized multi-dimensional data structure - the data cube. This paper will especially focus on the transformations necessary to normalize the structure of the tables. A second focus is on the advantages, which come by using the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary. Also, a research prototype was implemented to execute the workflow and convert the statistical data into data cubes.
